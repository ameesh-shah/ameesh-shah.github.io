<div><p>Hi! I'm currently a First Year Ph.D student at UC Berkeley, where I'm advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/">Sanjit Seshia</a>.</p></div>

<div><p>My research interests revolve around making machine learning (ML) more trustworthy in real-world applications. I'm primarily interested in improving the interpretability and verifiability of ML models, both of which are critical if we want to deploy these solutions in safety-critical settings. In order to pursue these improvements, I'm researching machine learning  solutions that incorporate concepts from the area of formal methods (FM). In doing so, I hope to marry the expressive power of state-of-the-art machine learning with the precise, deterministic properties of FM techniques. Please see my research for some examples of this intersectional work if you're interested.</p></div>

<div><p>I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Rice University, where I worked at the intersection of program synthesis and machine learning. I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/">Swarat Chaudhuri</a>, who I worked with on the <a href="http://www.neurosymbolic.org/kickoff.html">"Understanding the World Through Code" NSF Expeditions Project</a>. As an undergrad, I also worked on projects with <a href="https://ankitlab.co/">Ankit Patel</a> and <a href="https://richb.rice.edu/">Richard Baraniuk</a>. I was fortunate to be supported by the <a href="https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/advising/fifth-year-masters">Rice CS Graduate Fellowship</a>.</p></div>

<div><p>I've also spent time at Microsoft Research AI, where I worked with Alex Polozov and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/grounded-reasoning-and-interactive-learning-grail/">GRAIL group</a> on interactive ML-driven program synthesis .</p></div>

<div><p>In my free time, I enjoy doing lot of things, including but not limited to: running, playing tennis, buying sneakers, cooking, generally vibing, and watching my beloved Cleveland sports teams lose year after year.</p></div>
