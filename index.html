<div><p>Hi! I'm currently a First Year Ph.D student at UC Berkeley, where I'm advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/">Sanjit Seshia</a>.</p></div>

<div><p>My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of <i>machine learning</i> and <i>formal methods</i>. In particular, I'm hoping to make our current ML systems more composable, verifiable, and interpretable by viewing them from the lens of formal specifications and models. I'm currently applying these formal learning techniques towards problems in Robotics and Inverse Reinforcement Learning, Program Synthesis, and Autonomous Vehicle Systems. Please see my research for some examples of this intersectional work if you're interested.</p></div>

<div><p>I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Rice University, where I worked at the intersection of program synthesis and machine learning. I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat/">Swarat Chaudhuri</a>, who I worked with on the <a href="http://www.neurosymbolic.org/kickoff.html">"Understanding the World Through Code" NSF Expeditions Project</a>. As an undergrad, I also worked on projects with <a href="https://ankitlab.co/">Ankit Patel</a> and <a href="https://richb.rice.edu/">Richard Baraniuk</a>. I was fortunate to be supported by the <a href="https://csweb.rice.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/advising/fifth-year-masters">Rice CS Graduate Fellowship</a>.</p></div>

<div><p>I've also spent time at Microsoft Research AI, where I worked with Alex Polozov and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/grounded-reasoning-and-interactive-learning-grail/">GRAIL group</a> on interactive ML-driven program synthesis.</p></div>

<div><p>In my free time, I enjoy doing a lot of things, including but not limited to: running, playing tennis, buying sneakers, cooking, and generally vibing. I'm originally from Cleveland, Ohio, and I love watching my beloved Cavaliers and Browns break my heart year after year.</p></div>
